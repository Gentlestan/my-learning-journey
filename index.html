            <p class="hero-txt hero-space">it has always been my dream to be a programmer but for some reasons was never commited to it. completed HTML and basic CSS from other online learning platform, however when I got to javascript, it just seems so difficult. I tried the much I could that period but it seems so difficult. I got tired and burnt out after a while. I gave up and faced my renewable energy and CCTV Installation business.</p>

              however, I was never comfortable with my line of work. I know I want a change and that change should be programming. a part of me kept telling me that you can't just give up easily after all there are millions of programmers in the world and as such you can do it. once in a while, i kept on watching short programming clips on youtube. A quote came through for me. " if you take the route only  a few have taken, you will arrive at the destination only a few have arrived".

                one faithful day, in my characteristic ways of watching short javascript videos on youtube, i came across this javascript video on youtube <a class="youtube-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M&t=525s" target="_blank">Javascript programming full course</a> by Per Harald Borgen. I was amazed at how this guy teach javascript with so much fun and ease and lots of exciting challenges to get you started. despite been an 8 hours video, I followed through to the end, thats exactly, how I followed per to scrimba and it has been fun all the way.
